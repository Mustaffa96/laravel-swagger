 * - Single Responsibility: Handles only authentication configuration
 * - Open/Closed: Extensible through custom guards and providers
 * - Interface Segregation: Focused authentication interface
 * - Dependency Inversion: Abstracts authentication implementation details

    | mechanisms used by this application to persist your user's data.
